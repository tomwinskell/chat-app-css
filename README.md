## Overview

This was a big challenge for me and I learned a lot.

There was a lot of trial and error for me.

I ended up using a combination of grid and flexbox for the layout. The styling of colours and fonts was quite easy.

I used a media query to make the design responsive for mobile users. This was also quite challenging as there were some small changes I needed to make.

### The challenge
